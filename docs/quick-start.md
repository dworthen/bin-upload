## Quick Start

**Requirements**

The following must be installed and available on your path.

- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): if publishing to npm
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/): if publishing to pypi

1. **Initialize a configuration file:**

   ```sh
   bin-upload init
   ```

   This will walk you through an interactive prompt and generate a `bin-upload.config.yaml` file.

2. **Pack binaries into publishable artifacts:**

   ```sh
   bin-upload pack
   ```

   This will generate artifacts that can be published to npm (tarballs), pypi (wheel), and GitHub (tarballs and zips).

3. **Publish the artifacts:**

   ```sh
   bin-upload publish
   ```

   This publishes the artifacts generated by the `pack` command.
